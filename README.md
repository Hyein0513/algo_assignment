##  Note on Report Submission
It was only after the deadline that I realized the submitted report was an incomplete version.  
While I fully understand that the evaluation will be based on the initially submitted report,  
I still felt it would be a shame not to share the completed final version.

For reference, I have included the final report in this repository.  
I would be sincerely grateful if you would consider reviewing it, even if only as a reference.

## Project Structure & Description
The `data/` folder contains the `.tsp` files used for experiments.  
Within this directory, `data/GT/` specifically includes the ground truth data.

Each algorithm has its own folder, named accordingly, containing its implementation in `.cpp` and `.h` files.

The `.csv` files in the `output_fin/` directory contain the final experimental results.  
Each file includes evaluation metrics and results obtained by varying the Î» (lambda) value for each algorithm.

The `output_fin/tour/` folder contains the final `.tour` files generated by the MST, Held-Karp, Insertion, and the proposed algorithm.  
Based on these `.tour` files, visualized tour images in `.png` format are generated and stored in the `vis_output_fin/` folder.
